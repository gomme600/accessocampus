## Sensors (i2c, spi, modbus etc)  ##
_______________

This repository contains several libraries for various kind of sensors like (non exhaustive):

- **TCN75A** i2c temperature sensor from Microchip, typical absolute precision: +/-1 degree,
- **MCP9808** i2c temperature sensor from Microchip, typical absolute precision: +/-0,25 degree,
- **TSL2561** i2c ambiant light sensor featuring dual capture zone (i.e with and without IR filter) to compute real lux values,
- **piface** (i.e original RPi1 Piface) spi board that features 8 digital input (for output see libactuator),
- etc
